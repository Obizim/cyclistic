## Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

This is one of the capstone project in the google data analytics course

### Objectives

The objective of this analysis is to explore historical bike trip data from Cyclistic to uncover key differences between casual riders and annual members. By understanding these differences, we aim to identify trends and behaviors that could inform targeted marketing strategies designed to convert casual riders into annual members. Ultimately, this analysis will help guide Cyclisticâ€™s efforts in maximizing the number of annual memberships, which are more profitable than single-ride or full-day passes.
